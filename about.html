        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As an
          <strong>Agriculture and Environmental Science graduate</strong> turned
          <strong>Computer Science student</strong> at Université de Montréal, I
          bring a unique perspective to technology. My background in environmental
          systems drives my interest in developing
          <strong>sustainable tech solutions</strong>
          that bridge ecological awareness with digital innovation.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Currently focusing on
          <strong>Python, data analysis, and web development</strong>, I'm
          passionate about applying analytical problem-solving skills to create
          impactful applications. When not coding, you'll find me exploring
          <strong>environmental datasets</strong> or contributing to open-source
          sustainability projects.
